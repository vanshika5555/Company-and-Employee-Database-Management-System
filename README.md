Company and Employee Database Management System
Problem Statement:
Managing employees and organizational workflows efficiently is a major challenge for companies, especially as businesses expand. Traditional methods like manual record-keeping and fragmented software solutions lead to inefficiencies in employee tracking, task assignments, performance evaluations, and overall workplace management. Companies struggle to maintain smooth communication across departments, leading to mismanagement, decreased productivity, and lack of employee engagement.
Proposed Solution:
Our web-based Company and Employee Database Management System provides a centralized platform for companies to efficiently manage their employees, assign tasks, and track progress across all departments. The platform aims to simplify workforce management by integrating the following features:
•	Employee Management: Add, update, or remove employees from the system with complete profile records.
•	Task Assignment & Tracking: Assign work to employees based on their roles and monitor task progress in real time.
•	Departmental Management: Organize employees by departments, ensuring streamlined workflow and structured communication.
•	Performance & Appreciation System: Track employee performance, provide feedback, and give recognitions or rewards.
•	Company Goals & Milestones: Define, update, and monitor company-wide goals to keep employees aligned with business objectives.
•	Secure Data Management: Maintain all employee records, department details, and company insights with high-level security.
•	Multi-Level Access Control: Provide different access levels for admins, managers, and employees to ensure data privacy.
•	Company Ranking System: Evaluate and rank companies based on various performance metrics, helping businesses understand their position in the industry and identify key competitors.
•	Technical Stack (Optional):
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)
•	Backend: Node.js with Express.js
